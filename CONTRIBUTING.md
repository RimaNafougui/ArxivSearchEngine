# Contributing to ArXiv RAG Research Assistant

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This is an open project and contributions of all kinds are welcome — bug fixes, new features, documentation improvements, and more.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/arxiv-search-engine.git
   cd arxiv-search-engine
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Copy the environment template** and fill in your credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Supabase URL, Supabase key, and Google API key
   ```

4. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

## What to Work On

Check the [Issues](../../issues) tab for open tasks. Contributions are especially welcome in these areas:

| Area | Examples |
|---|---|
| **New data sources** | Add support for Semantic Scholar, PubMed, or other preprint servers |
| **Search quality** | Experiment with different embedding models or hybrid search (BM25 + vector) |
| **UI improvements** | Better paper cards, keyboard shortcuts, dark/light theme toggle |
| **ETL robustness** | Better error handling, retry logic, incremental updates |
| **Testing** | Unit tests for retrieval logic, ETL pipeline, and prompt formatting |
| **Documentation** | Tutorials, architecture diagrams, example notebooks |

## Development Guidelines

### Code style
- Follow the existing style (PEP 8, no unnecessary type annotations on unchanged code)
- Keep functions small and focused — the existing helpers (`retrieve_documents`, `build_answer`, etc.) are good references
- Add comments only where the logic isn't self-evident

### Streamlit conventions
- Persist results in `st.session_state` so the UI doesn't reset on every interaction
- Use `@st.cache_data` for any function that fetches data from Supabase or an external API
- Avoid calling `st.rerun()` unless strictly necessary

### Commits
- Use imperative commit messages: `Add BibTeX export for reading list`, not `Added BibTeX export`
- Keep commits focused — one logical change per commit

---

## Pull Request Process

1. Make sure the app runs without errors: `streamlit run app.py`
2. If you changed the ETL pipeline, test it against a small batch first
3. Update `README.md` if your change adds or removes a feature
4. Open a pull request against `main` with a clear description of what you changed and why

PRs will be reviewed within a few days. Feedback will be constructive — if a change needs adjustment, the review will say why.

## Reporting Bugs

Open an [issue](../../issues/new) and include:
- A clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce it
- What you expected vs. what happened
- Relevant error messages or screenshots

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL (`https://xxx.supabase.co`) |
| `SUPABASE_KEY` | Supabase service role key (keep this secret) |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Google AI Studio key for Gemini access |
